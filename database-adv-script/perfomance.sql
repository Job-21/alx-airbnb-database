-- 1. Initial Complex Query: Get bookings with user, property, and payment details
SELECT 
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    p.id AS property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.id AS payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
JOIN payments pay ON b.id = pay.booking_id;

-- 2. Analyze the performance before optimization
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    p.id AS property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.id AS payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
JOIN payments pay ON b.id = pay.booking_id;

-- 3. Optimized Query (only selects necessary columns and avoids redundant joins)
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.name AS user_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
JOIN payments pay ON b.id = pay.booking_id;
